# Welcome to Roberto Di Stefano's Portfolio!

Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to have you here and share with you my journey as a developer. This portfolio is not just a showcase of my work; it's a reflection of my passion for coding, my dedication to mastering new technologies, and my commitment to delivering high-quality projects.


## Exploring the Project

Within this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my projects, each crafted with care and attention to detail. From sleek web applications to interactive experiences, every project represents a unique challenge and an opportunity for growth. I believe in pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation, and I hope my portfolio reflects that ambition.

## Embracing Modern Technologies

In developing this portfolio, I've utilized a diverse range of cutting-edge technologies to bring my vision to life. From the dynamic capabilities of React and Typescript to the sleek design elements of Tailwind CSS, every tool serves a purpose in creating a seamless user experience. Firebase empowers me to manage data efficiently, while WebGL (Three.js - React Three Fiber) adds a touch of immersive 3D magic. With Framer Motion, I bring animations to life, adding flair and personality to each interaction.

## Setting Up the Project

Ready to dive in and explore my portfolio on your own machine? Let me guide you through the setup process:

1. Make sure you have React version 18.2.0 or higher and npm version 9.6.7 or higher installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/disteroby/disteroby-dev-porfolio.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory and install all dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. To configure Firebase for your project, create a `.env` file in the project root and provide the necessary environment variables as listed in the instructions.

5. Now, fire up the project locally by running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer, you can start the optimized build version locally with:
   ```bash
   npm run build:preview
   ```
